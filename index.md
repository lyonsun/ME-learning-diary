# Welcome!

This is Lyon Sun, coming from Hunan, China.

I am a web developer now located in Lahti, Finland.

I can work both in front end and back end. Programming languages I am mainly using are PHP and Go.

In other times than study and work, what I love to do are reading, playing chess, fishing, photographing, and specially sports such as basketball, skiing and so on.

This is a place for me to record what I learned in courses in Master of Engineering. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
