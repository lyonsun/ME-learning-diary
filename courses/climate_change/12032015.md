## Climate change and green infrastructure

> Elisa LÃ¤hde

### background and key concepts

1. Resilience
2. Green infrastructure
3. Ecosystem services
4. Stormwater management

**Urban Earth**

**Urban problems**

1. transport congestion
2. lack of sufficient housing
3. over-rapid growth
4. environmental degradation

#### Resilience

systems ability to return to a form more or less as the original one, to quickly recover from disturbance.

**Urban Resilience**

How to increase urban resilience?

#### GI

rising paradigm

cases:

2. [thehighline.org](http://thehighline.org)

##### Gray infra vs. Green infra

Benefits of GI: Return to investments.

#### Ecosystem services

##### Definition

a network

ecosystem services: benefits people obtained from ecosystems.

**The Cascade Model**

The CM chains the ecosystem service flow of five categories: structures(and processes), functions, services, benefits and values. 

Biological structures, processes and functions are part of the GI in urban context.

Biological structures & Function -> ESS (Ecosystem services) > Human well-beings (Benefits & Values)

##### Types of ESS

1. Regulating services
2. Provisioning services: food, water, energy, and other resources
3. Cultural services: information, cultural and aestetical benefits ecosystems deliver

#### Stormwater management

**a major climate adaptation issue for cities**

4. ICSC: 

### new and surprising defenders
