# Presentation by Paul

## COP21 in Paris

## The central themes

1. events and issues in COP21
2. CO2 emissions reductions
3. why environmental engineering - so-called techno-fixes are not the solution
4. why fossil fuels are way past their peak and why we need to move on and fully switch to renewables

**Evolution is a theory!**

## Definitions

1. Anthropogenic: human activity
2. Mitigation: action taken to permanently eliminate or reduce long-term risks
3. Adaptation: the ability of a system to adjust climate change to moderate potential damage, to take advantage, or to cope with the consequences.
4. Techno-fix: a technological solution to a problem
5. Geo-engineering: one form of techno-fix
6. Eco-centric and techno-centric
7. paradigm shift

**Alternative Environmental Paradigms**

Key Assumptions -> Technocemtrism, Ecocentrism and Sustaincentrism.

## Global temperature

> "mitigate for 2, adapt for 4" - Robert Watson 

global temperature is not very accurate

**The Keeling Curve**

**20-20-20**

## Pre Course Presentation

1. national transport sector
2. global zero emissions scenarios
3. green farming and climate change

## Controlling the local weather compared to controlling the global climate

## The most reliable and only scure solution

decrease co2 emissions by increasing renewable energy source usage

1. Biomass in Finland
2. Solar
	1. Photovoltaic
	2. Hot water
	3. Mirrors	
3. Windpower

### Biogas VS Natural gas

**0g CO2/kwh vs 198g/kwh**

Largest biogas plant in Finland - Labio in Lahti
