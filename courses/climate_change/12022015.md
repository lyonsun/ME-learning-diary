## Topic 1: Climate Change & Denial - A losing cause

**UNCCC - united nations conference on climate changes**

### The central themes

1. there has been a systematic campaign to reduce the credibility of climate change dangers?
2. Poor science has been used to deny global warming
3. energy industry and big money flow has been behind all these...

### Promoting denial

types of rhetoric and denial arguments:

1. Populism: mad scientists
2. Positive sides of climate change is stressed: nice weather..
3. experts are from wrong field of science
4. they tend to demand 100% proof claiming
5. global warming is only a theory


## Topic 2: Climate change impacts and adaptation in the context of urban and regional planning

### agenda

1. context
2. applications


### Contexts


#### RATIONAL URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING

**Urban planning and regional planning cannot be separated.**

Three overarching skills:

1. visionary
2. technical expert
3. mediator

#### Climate related impacts

##### Approaching impacts

1. aspect: direct vs. indirect (mechanism)
2. aspect: time horizon (duration)
	1. short-term: a shock at the event
	2. long-term: a lasting shock that may or may not fade away
3. aspect: contexts (identification of details)
	1. who is affected
	2. when
	3. how
	4. how much
	5. for how long
	
#### Type of adaptation

1. autonumous
2. planned
3. a combination of these two

##### what the real issue is in adaptation

**boundary conditions have shifted**

#### Integrated approaches: ABM and CA simulation

1. Agent-based models:
2. Cellular automata

#### Integreated approaches: LUTI modelling

** Land use / Transport integrated models **

#### Failed approaches

1. batman failing
2. half-informed planning
3. efficiency VS. equity, economists VS. planners

#### Elephants in the room

1. populatioin growth
2. value conflicts
3. system complexity
4. scenarios

### Applications

#### Flood risk information shocks & housing prices

1. lake & river system floods
2. ..

#### Flood risk information releases

#### hedonic pricing

1. housing is a good represents a large bundle of structural, locational, and neighborhood attributes.
2. imperfect information and "incorrect" value attribution are often the case
3. especially in coastal area





## Topic 3: Climate issues in Lahti City

### content of the lecture

1. climate change in general and locally
2. climate change mitigation

### The city strategy is the key driver in climate mitigation


### actions against climate change

1. new transportation systems
2. new projects and plans
3. participation process
4. [energy choice service in 2016](http://www.bionova.fi/en/news/bionova-ltd-has-been-chosen-service-partner-eco-efficient-energy-service)

### adaptation & mitigation overlapping



## Topic 4: Climate Orientated Design - Simple approach

### traditional approach

understanding of local conditions
 
case: antillanmÃ¤ki
 
### rural village

situation in the landscape

case: Iitti

### traditional wooden towns

image for new dense and low areas

case: rauma

### Example of practices

> Neighbourhood Planning - Kirhonen, A. 1975

Predetermined factors VS. Unpredetermined factors.

**Topography analysis**

#### Buildings in a slope 

case: Aurinkorinne, Espoo

###  Example of measurements

1. light of room blocks
2. sunniness of yards
3. shadiness reseraches
4. windiness and micro-climate
5. vegetation
6. noise protection

### Green factor

green factor = scored green area / lot area

#### background & goals
